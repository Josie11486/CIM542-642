## What is a Text Editor

A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Whether you are writing for html or another programming language, you will use a text editor to write your code.

### Why not use Word or TextEdit

The reason we use a text editor is that they allow use to write our code with no extra markup. When you use Word or TextEdit they normally add extra information into the file for encode things like bold, spacing, fonts, etc. Also with Word, for example, you generally save as a docx extension. With a text editor you can save as multiple file types.
